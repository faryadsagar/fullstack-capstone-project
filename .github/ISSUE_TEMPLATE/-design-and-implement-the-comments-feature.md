**As a** full-stack developer  
**I need** to implement a comments feature for gifts  
**So that** users can leave feedback and interact with each other.

### Details and Assumptions
* Users should be able to post, edit, and delete comments.
* Comments should be stored in the database and associated with a gift.

### Acceptance Criteria
Given a gift has comments,  
When a user posts a new comment,  
Then the comment should appear on the gift details page.
