**As a** back-end developer  
**I need** to initialize and populate MongoDB  
**So that** the application has a database to store user and gift data.

### Details and Assumptions
* MongoDB will be used for data storage.
* Sample data (e.g., users, gifts) will be required for testing.

### Acceptance Criteria
Given that MongoDB is installed,  
When the database is initialized,  
Then sample data will be inserted, and the connection to the backend will be established.
