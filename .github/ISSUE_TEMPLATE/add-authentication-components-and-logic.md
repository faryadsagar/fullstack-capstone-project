**As a** back-end developer  
**I need** to add authentication components and logic  
**So that** users can register, log in, and access secured parts of the app.

### Details and Assumptions
* JWT (JSON Web Token) will be used for authentication.
* The frontend will have forms for login and registration.

### Acceptance Criteria
Given the user provides valid credentials,  
When they log in,  
Then a token should be issued, and the user should be authenticated.
