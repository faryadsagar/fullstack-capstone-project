**As a** DevOps engineer  
**I need** to containerize the services and applications using Docker  
**So that** the app can be deployed in a consistent environment across different systems.

### Details and Assumptions
* Dockerfiles should be created for both the backend and frontend.
* Both services should be able to run in containers.

### Acceptance Criteria
Given the Dockerfiles are created,  
When the containers are built and run,  
Then both the backend and frontend should work as expected in isolated environments.
