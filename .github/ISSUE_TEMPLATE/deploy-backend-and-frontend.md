**As a** DevOps engineer  
**I need** to deploy the backend and frontend  
**So that** users can access the live application on the web.

### Details and Assumptions
* The backend will be deployed to a cloud platform (e.g., AWS, Heroku).
* The frontend will be deployed separately or on the same platform.

### Acceptance Criteria
Given the deployment process is completed,  
When the application is accessed via a URL,  
Then both the backend and frontend should be functional and live.
