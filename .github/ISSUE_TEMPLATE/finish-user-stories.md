**As a** product owner  
**I need** detailed user stories for the GiftLink project  
**So that** the development team can understand the tasks and proceed with clear goals.

### Details and Assumptions
* The user stories should cover all the essential features of the project.

### Acceptance Criteria
Given the project scope,  
When user stories are written,  
Then they should describe clear tasks and include goals for development.
