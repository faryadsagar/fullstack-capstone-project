**As a** front-end developer  
**I need** to implement a landing page and navigation  
**So that** users can easily navigate through the application.

### Details and Assumptions
* The landing page should be simple with links to key sections of the app.
* Navigation should include links like "Home", "Gifts", "Login".

### Acceptance Criteria
Given the landing page design,  
When a user visits the page,  
Then they should see a navigation bar with links to the main sections.
