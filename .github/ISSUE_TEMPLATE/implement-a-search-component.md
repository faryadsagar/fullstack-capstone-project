**As a** front-end developer  
**I need** to implement a search component  
**So that** users can search for gifts by name or category.

### Details and Assumptions
* The search component should have input fields for keywords and categories.
* The results should dynamically filter based on user input.

### Acceptance Criteria
Given the search input is provided,  
When the search is executed,  
Then the results should be filtered by the keyword or category and displayed.
