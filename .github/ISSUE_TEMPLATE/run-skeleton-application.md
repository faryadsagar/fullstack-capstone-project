**As a** full-stack developer  
**I need** to run the skeleton application  
**So that** I can have a basic structure for both backend and frontend ready for development.

### Details and Assumptions
* The skeleton application should include basic routing for both the backend (Express) and frontend (React).
* Both parts of the application should be running in a local development environment.

### Acceptance Criteria
Given the skeleton app is set up,  
When the application is run,  
Then both backend and frontend should be accessible and connected.
